          "The Lost Battalion stressed the individual aspect of war. Major Charles Whittlesey, who was declared as one of the three most important members of the American Expeditionary Force and a Medal of Honor recipient, was a school teacher before he was drafted to lead men into battle.  Many of the men in Whittlessey’s battalion were shop keepers, clerks, and construction workers whose lives were interrupted due to the outbreak of World War I.  The ''Lost Battalion'' was not even a battalion but was two companies of about 500 men that were not even lost, but rather surrounded.  During an offensive in the Argonne Forest this battalion was the only one that managed to advance.  The Germans launched eight attacks against the unit over a five day span of time and the men ran out of food the first day.  A&E depicts the movie with historical accuracy and like Saving Private Ryan, used hand held cameras to capture battle scenes more vividly.   The battles took place near the end of the war and at the end of the movie the General the arrived told Whittlesey that the losses the battalion suffered were “acceptable”.  Whittlesey was so troubled after the war because of the experiences he went through that he committed suicide in March of 1921.  The movie does a great job, sadly, of displaying how much the soldiers suffered and how hard it actually is to fight in thick forests.",
          "Tom Miller, a critic writting for Military.com, puts forth that ''The script is compelling on several levels. Whittlesey, the bookish-looking New York lawyer turned soldier, is the Everyman Warrior that viewers enjoy identifying with. Most would like to think that placed in a similar situation they too would find the courage to act as Whittlesey did.''",
          "When most average viewers finish watching the movie they leave with an impression in their minds of what World War I was like and what the soldiers had gone through. They do think that they would be able to accomplish what this ''battalion'' did if they were in the same position, when actually many would not be capable of doing so.",
          "Miller also argues that the viewer is misinformed as they believe that they pulled off a vital mission in the war and that small groups of men could really change the course. Miller says that ''[The Lost Battalion] also leaves the impression that Schroder was commanding a single battalion rather than companies from two separate battalions. And, worst, the movie gives the siege an undeserved tactical significance in the larger battle for the Argonne Forest. What Whittlesey and his men did needs no embellishment.''"

          "Pearl Harbor was released in the summer of 2001 and got a variety of reviews. Critic Roger Ebert summarized the movie as ''a two-hour movie squeezed into three hours, about how on December 7, 1941, the Japanese staged a surprise attack on an American love triangle,'' adding that, ''The filmmakers seem to have aimed the film at an audience that may not have heard of Pearl Harbor, or perhaps even of World War Two.''",
          "Mark Dujsik comically mocks the movie by saying “[Evelyn] is on a train with her fellow nurses, headed somewhere, and we are treated to a flashback of one of the most annoying meet-cutes in recent memory. Evelyn was doing eye tests for the pilots, and Rafe either can’t see, can’t read, or is just stupid. By the end of the movie, I still wasn’t sure of which it was. Evelyn let’s him pass, and one drug-overdose, concussion, and broken nose later, they go out on a date.”  Tora! Tora! Tora! is mentioned quite often by movie critics when they are attacking Pearl Harbor.  However, Tora! Tora! Tora!, was a flop at the box office and has only picked up some respect in recent years. ",
          "Rafe Mcawley and Danny Walker, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett, grow up as childhood friends who dream about being fighter pilots.  By 1940 they are in the US Army’s Air Corps together.  Rave goes off to Europe t o fight for the British and is presumed dead after a few weeks of fighting.  However, Rave comes back to Hawaii, much to the surprise of Danny and Evelyn, in time for the attacks on Pearl Harbor.  Both put up impressive kills during the attacks and are asked by Colonel Doolittle if they want to participate on a daring attack that he can not disclose until they have already set sail months later."

          "Steven Spielberg said he wanted to show that ''war is immediate; it’s chaotic, it’s abrupt, and it’s without mercy'' in his movie Saving Private Ryan.(Source 1)  Movie critic James Berardinelli describes the movie by saying ''Spielberg spares the viewer nothing of the horrors of battle, using every tactic at his disposal to convey the chaos and senselesswaste that lies at the core of any engagement.'' (Source 2) Spielberg uses a  unique w ay to capture battle scenes in the movie by using handheld cameras to film.  Saving Private Ryan is a three hour long movie and the movie only has two major battle scenes.  Berardinelli states that ''In between, smaller fights alternate with quiet, character-building moments that flesh out the soldiers…ensures that everyone in the movie is developed into a multi-dimensional individual for whom we can grieve if and when they die. They are ''citizen soldiers'' -- ordinary men caught in the teeth of extraordinary circumstances.''  What is unique about Saving Private Ryan was that the mission in the movie was to save one man, Ryan. The movie opens and closes with Ryan visiting Captain Miller’s grave with his family.",
          "The films Saving Private Ryan shows the struggles of a small unit in a full scare war.  The platoon of men in the film were assigned one mission which was to find and return Private Ryan back stateside. Like Windtalkers the leading character, Captain Miller, dies in the end and the character that was saved memorializes this leading character.",
          "This movie is only loosly based on historic fact. Many proclaim that the opening 30 minute scene is one of the best in representing the invasion of Normandy. The recreation is very violent and focuses on Miller and him leading a group up the beach to take out some stationary machine guns overlooking the beach. In this opening sequence Spielberg said he was ''trying to show something [other] war films hadn't dared to show''. He wanted to show that ''war is immediate; it's chaotic; it's abrupt, and it's without mercy''. (source 5)",
          "Lawrence H. Suid is right in the fact that no movie can ''capture the reality of men trying to survive in the hostile environment of the battlefield'' he is over exaggerating when he says ''whether or not people actually think that the actors are acting during the scenes and go home after a days work is a hard point to prove. While watching the graphic D-Day scenes in Saving Private Ryan some shriek in horror and find it hard to believe that the battles, especially this invasion was actually this intense. Even more people will use films such as Saving Private Ryan to create their own recreations in their minds of what they think the scenes were like. It doesn't matter if audiences knew that ''soldiers had actually climbed the same cliff in the face of withering German fire'' or that ''they also know that a real paratrooper had landed on that steeple and was actually shot by a German soldier''. What matters is that Saving Private Ryan depicts the gruesome reality of the war and that it left audiences shocked at what those men had to go through, or how many men never actually stepped out of their landing craft alive when the door dropped down."
